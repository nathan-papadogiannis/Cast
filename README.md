# Cast! - Your Personalized Weather Companion

## Welcome Aboard!
Set sail with Cast! - your trusted companion for weather forecasts that truly get you. We believe that weather information should be more than just numbers. Cast! provides a **human-centered forecast experience**, helping you make informed decisions based on how you'll _personally_ feel in the current weather conditions.

## Be The Captain
Cast! offers a unique feature that allows you to fine-tune your forecast. If the forecast suggests warm weather, but you sense a chill in the air, you can "argue". Cast! listens to your input and tailors the forecast to match your unique comfort and preferences. After all, you're the boss!

We understand that the same temperature can evoke different sensations for different individuals. That's why Cast! provides a forecast that goes beyond the ordinary, giving you weather insights that align with how you uniquely experience the elements.
