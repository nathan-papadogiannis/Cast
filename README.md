# Cast
*A weather app for people with skin!*

## Personalized Forecasts
Gone are the days of wondering what the hell 70% humidity feels like. With Cast!, your unique response to cold, hot, dry, humid, windy, and rainy shapes how your forecast is brought to you. Say Cast! had the *nerve* to tell you 80 degrees is a scorcher, now you can finally with a click of a button tell the Weather app that it was wrong. Then, the next time its 80 degrees, Cast! will use what it learned to tell you it's absolutely wonderful outside...to you!

## Sleek Design
I don't need information about the latest cat caught in a tree in Indiana. When I go to check the weather, I want to know one thing--**Will today suck if I don't wear a jacket???** With all the distractions cut out, Cast! will get you your answers as quick as possible so you can get back to searching through your winter clothes before the bus arrives.

## Work In Progress
Cast! is based off of a prototype of mine from yesteryear, and in making this app twice I've seen a lot of my progress since then. I hope to finally make Cast! a reality and start hosting it publicly once more features are solidified. If you want to keep updated, be sure to check back or send me a message.
